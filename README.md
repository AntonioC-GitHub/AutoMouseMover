# AutoMouseMover
This is a mouse moving tool I made using pyautogui which is code that can make your mouse and keyboard do commands. In this scenario I built it so your mouse will auto move around the screen for you from 9am-5pm in the user's local time so this way, if they have any work messaging apps like slack then their status is online.
